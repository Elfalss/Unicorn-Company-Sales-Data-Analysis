Seasonal Trends: Sales peak in September, November, and December, but these months also negatively affect the profit margin, especially in 2018.

Significant losses in the South region in late 2018, particularly in Technology orders.

**State-Level Insights:**

Ten states, including Texas, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, have consistently shown negative profits since 2015.
Ceasing trade in these states would improve profitability by ~$42K.

**Discount Strategy:**

51% of all orders have a 20%+ discount, accounting for $1.1M in sales.
Discounts have a negative correlation with profit, indicating a need to reevaluate the pricing strategy.
Supplier Performance:

High-volume suppliers like Hon deliver low profits, whereas lower-volume suppliers like Xerox generate higher profits.

## Recommendations

Focus discounts on high-margin products rather than applying blanket discounts.
Review and adjust discount strategies to align with profit goals.

**Optimize Product Mix:**

Remove underperforming furniture products and focus on promoting Office Supplies.
Phase out unprofitable products (e.g., specific 3D printers) and negotiate better terms with low-profit suppliers.

**Targeted Regional Strategies:**

Develop localized marketing and supply chain strategies to improve performance in low-profit regions (Central and East).
Tailor action plans for states with consistent negative profit.

**Customer Segmentation:**

Increase retention and loyalty by developing personalized strategies for each customer segment (Consumers, Corporate, Home Office).
Implement loyalty programs and offer personalized promotions to increase engagement.
Supplier Diversification:

**Seasonal Sales Planning:**

Plan ahead for high-sales periods in September, November, and December by managing discounts and stock levels effectively.
